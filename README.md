# HWH but with ReactJs
## Second trial.

**HWH** (Homework helper) is a final project of mine when I was studying at **Step Academy** (2019). <br>
After that I've mastered many concepts in full-stack development and this is my second go of making same app. <br>
The whole point of the project was that data was saved on localstorage. Here I've embraced the tradition and used local file `db.json` to store information. <br><br>

you can see the old project here: [HWH with pure javascript](https://hwh-old.netlify.app/) <br>

*to setup this project you'll need to host server and website on localhost concurrently* <br>
*script of the server is in the `package.json` file*

Used packages: axios, json-server <br>
`npm install axios` <br>
`npm install json-server@0`
